* Emacs
** Dooom Emacs

The [[file:emacs/doom/packages.el]] allows the installation of the necessary packages and [[file:emacs/doom/config.el]] is the configuration file. It is necessary to run ~doom sync~ to perform the installation and apply the configuration.

** Taking notes workflow

I use Zotero to create a bibliography and download the papers, with emacs I can associate org note to a pdf. The details of the emacs workflow is detailled [[https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-note-workflow/][here]]. I am not totally satisfied with it and will try to modify it when I have more time (organize notes by fields and projects instead of using only one bibliography).
I access the bibliography with helm-bibtex.
