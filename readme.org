* Emacs
** Dooom Emacs

The [[file:emacs/packages.el]] allows the installation of the necessary packages and [[file:emacs/config.el]] is the configuration file. It is necessary to run ~doom sync~ to perform the installation and apply the configuration.

** Taking notes workflow

I use Zotero to create a bibliography and download the papers, with emacs I can associate an org note to a pdf.
I access the bibliography with helm-bibtex.
