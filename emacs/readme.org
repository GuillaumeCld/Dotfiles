I use [[https://www.orgroam.com/][org-roam]] to manage my notes.

I can create (spc r n) several types of notes.

They can be specified in the [[./config.el][setup file]] in the org-roam part, where I can detail the notes filename, save location and header.


I use [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Zotero]] to manage my bibliography and to generate a .bibtex which can be then used in emacs with [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex][helm-bibtex]] (M-x helm-bibtex).

With helm-bibtex I can create and attach notes to each paper. These notes are also managed with org-roam.
Again in  the setup file I can specify the header of the file.

With org-roam I can search (spc n r f) through my notes either by note name, type (@) or file tags (#).
[[../.Pictures/nodes_search.png]]

A note can be inserted (spc n r i) into another note. (spc n r s ) to sync the database.


With [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][org-roam-ui]] I can visualize the graph of my notes.

Finally with [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] I can create a website like in [[https://braindump.jethro.dev/]].
I created a [[./Makefile][makefile]] to make using ox-hugo with my framework more confortable.
